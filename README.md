# GT-seq-optimization
This repository contains the data and R scripts used to generate figures associated with the GT-seq panel optimization rounds presented in the manuscript. The workflows are modular and can be readily reused by supplying user-provided GT-seq or comparable genotyping data to reproduce the analyses or apply them to new panel development efforts.
